# Purpose

This guide provides examples for how to create RMC-TotalRisk models for common risk analysis applications. The following examples are included in the guide: 

1. Hydrologic Hazard - Single POtential Failure Mode
2. Hydrologic Hazard - Multiple Potential Failure Modes
3. Seismic Hazard - Embankment - Single Potential Failure Mode
4. Seismic Hazard - Embankment - Multiple Potential Failure Modes
5. Seismic Hazard - Concrete Spillway Failure - Single Potential Failure Mode
6. Seismic Hazard - Concrete Spillway Failure - Multiple Potential Failure Modes

These examples are intended to be a starting point for the user to create project-specific risk analyses in RMC-TotalRisk.
